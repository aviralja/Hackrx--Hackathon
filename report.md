  "justification": "While the RAG tool indicates potential coverage for surgical procedures in a day care center, it does not provide sufficient information regarding specific coverage for cataract surgery, including sub-limits or exclusions.  Without this crucial information, I cannot approve the claim.  More detailed policy information is needed to assess the claim accurately. The retrieved text mentions surgery in day care centers but lacks specifics about cataract surgery coverage."
